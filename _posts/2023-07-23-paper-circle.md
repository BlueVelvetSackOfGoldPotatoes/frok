## What?

Let's read a paper, then present, discuss and inquire.
Basically, a journal club.

## Why?

To learn about what our circle considers relevant work.
To seed and share ideas, to embrace habit and to enjoy.

## Where?

Online via Jitsi Meet. Join [here](https://meet.jit.si/moderated/688f9c1ae8de7318c8ea63c45fa7d0b6979770a0350469b63174d5347288a8d7).

Join our Signal [group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIGAHhlxis2kyvc4qQYZQzZVKU-WamcbwhX1ml7Fhkr2YEhDHYoSSHgkMYbrEiJiR6gT_) for asynchronous communication.

## When?

Thursday, 17th of August from 18:00 to 19:15 CEST.
We voted on [Rallly](https://rallly.co/invite/5bMEHVjJF9ek).

## How?

1. We read Geoffrey Hinton, 2023. The Forward-Forward Algorithm: Some Preliminary Investigation. https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13345
2. Before meeting, an attendee may choose to present the paper, if so, this will be recorded here. The presenter may take inspiration from this [guide](https://bitesizebio.com/13633/journal-club-guide/).
3. Attendees discuss.
    - Judge the quality and impact of the paper.
    - Ask questions of clarification.
    - Propose related papers.
    - Make connections to other areas of research.
